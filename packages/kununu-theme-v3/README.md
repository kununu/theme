# @kununu/kununu-theme-v3

> kununu UI on a SCSS theme

kununu's basic styling. It contains everything from reset, colors, gradients, typography and media breakpoints that are used on kununu applications.

## 📦 Installation

Install and save as a dependency on your project:
```console
npm install --save @kununu/kununu-theme-v3
```

## 💻 Usage

Import files in your SCSS to begin using right away:

```scss
@import "~@kununu/kununu-theme-v3/scss/base";
@import "~@kununu/kununu-theme-v3/scss/variables";
@import "~@kununu/kununu-theme-v3/scss/typography";
```

Remember that all the styles are SCSS and need to be compiled. Check [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) documentation if you're using Webpack to bundle your assets.
